## 4.	In general, how did it go: 
Kanban boards in GitHub are widely used for project management and task tracking purposes, and many teams find them effective in improving their workflow and collaboration. Here are some general observations about using Kanban boards in GitHub:

Visual Organization: Kanban boards provide a visual representation of tasks, allowing teams to see the progress and status of work at a glance. This visual organization helps in better understanding the overall project and individual tasks.

Collaborative Work: Kanban boards facilitate collaboration among team members. They can assign tasks to individuals, leave comments or updates on specific tasks, and mention or tag other team members to enhance communication and coordination.

Transparency and Accountability: Kanban boards promote transparency by making the project's status and progress visible to all team members. This fosters accountability and ensures that everyone is aware of their responsibilities and the status of their tasks.

## 5.	What was the most difficult part: 
Based on common challenges that we encounter while using Kanban Boards, here are a few difficulties that we faced:

Workflow Alignment: Adapting the Kanban Board to match the team's existing workflow can be a complex task. Integrating the board with the team's established processes and ensuring smooth collaboration among team members may require adjustment and communication.

Maintaining Discipline: Kanban emphasizes limiting work in progress (WIP) and maintaining a balanced workload. Encouraging team members to adhere to WIP limits and resist the temptation to take on too many tasks simultaneously can be a continuous challenge.

Prioritization and Time Management: Effectively prioritizing tasks and managing deadlines within the Kanban Board can be difficult, especially when multiple tasks are vying for attention. Determining which tasks to focus on and ensuring timely completion require careful planning and decision-making.

## 6.	What was most interesting:
The most intriguing aspect of GitHub project boards is their ability to provide a visual representation of project tasks, progress, and status.

## 7.	What are the best parts of your group's board (what are you most proud of):
